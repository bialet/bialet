  <strong>Make Web Development Great Again</strong>

Bialet is the [worst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better) web
development framework ever.

Would you like a strongly typed programming language with strong unit testing support?
Well, this is not the framework you are looking for, here we want to **ship features**.

```wren
import "bialet" for Response

// Look how short and sweet it is
class Config {
  static get(key){ `SELECT val FROM config WHERE key = ?`.first(key)["val"] }
}

// Or maybe you need other functions to interact with the values,
// so it makes sense to create the good ol' class that makes objects.
class ConfigValue {
  construct new(key) {
    _config = `SELECT * FROM config WHERE key = ?`.first(key)
  }
  key { _config["key"].upper }
  val { _config["val"] }
  toString { val }
}

var title = Config.get("title") // This is a string
var description = ConfigValue.new("description") // This is a ConfigValue
// ...they are both objects though ü§î

// Let's log the values in the server output
System.print("üîç TITLE: %(title)")
System.print("üîç %(description.key): %(description.val)")

// Remember the times were you write actual HTML?
Response.out('
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <body>
    <h1>%( title )</h1>
    <p>%( description )</p>
  </body>
</html>
')
```

This was written in [Wren programming language](https://wren.io), though a custom heavily modified version. See [more examples](examples/run.md) for usage.

## Installation

The best way to use it is with Docker. In the root of the project run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Use the environment variables **BIALET_DIR** and **BIALET_PORT** to change the
default values.

## Building

Install SQLite3, OpenSSL 3 and curl for dev dependencies and run the build.

In Debian based

```bash
sudo apt install -y libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

In MacOS

```bash
brew install sqlite3 openssl curl
```

Then run the build

```bash
make clean && make
```

### Running with binary

```bash
bialet -p 7000 /path/to/root
```

Available Configuration

| Description | Argument | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Port | -p | 7000 |
| Host | -h | localhost |
| Log file | -l | stdout |
| Memory limit | -m | 50 (in Megabytes) |
| Hard memory limit | -M | 100 (in Megabytes) |
| CPU limit | -c | 15 |
| Hard CPU limit | -C | 30 |

## Credits

~I copy a lot of code from all over the web~

Bialet incorporates the work of several open-source projects and contributors. We extend our gratitude to:

- The [Wren programming language](https://wren.io), for its lightweight, flexible, and high-performance capabilities.
- The [Mongoose library](https://github.com/expressjs/mongoose), for providing an easy-to-use web server solution.
- Matthew Brandly, for his invaluable contributions to JSON parsing and utility functions in Wren. Check out his work at [Matthew Brandly's GitHub](https://github.com/brandly/wren-json).
- @PureFox48 for the upper and lower functions.
- [Codeium](https://github.com/codeium) for the [Codeium](https://codeium.com) plugin, ChatGPT and a lot of coffee.

We encourage users to explore these projects and recognize the efforts of their creators.
